# Data Science Essentials: Data Cleaning

In the world of data science, where numbers are the raw material and insights are the endgame, there's a game-changing step that often doesn't get the spotlight it deserves â€” data cleaning. Imagine setting out on a data adventure only to find your path blocked by errors, inconsistencies, and missing pieces of crutial information. That's where data cleaning steps in, turning messy datasets into the tidy fuel that powers spot-on analyses.

Data cleaning isn't just a routine; it's like magic that turns data chaos into order. We're about to dive into the nitty-gritty of this transformative process, peeling back the curtain on the challenges that data scientists face. From handling outliers to fixing mix-ups, each part of the cleaning journey plays a role in sculpting a dataset that's not just clean but also trustworthy.

There are many steps that are involved in the process, but in this repository, I will highlight many of the important aspects and methods I have learned over my data science journey.
